# SuperMarket-system
Analysis, design and implementation of a supermarket system manages employees, trucking, inventory, branches, and suppliers of the supermarket.

 Project with 8 students, each pair received a modul. At each stage of the project we integrate the models. 
 During the project the customer adds and changes his requirements, and we as a group need to change the design of the system accordingly.
 the system is designed in a modular and balanced way in the time ratio given to us, as to support those changes. 
 
 the implementation is based on 4-lvl-tier with presentation level based on MVVM mattern
 In addition to the implementation there are very detailed analysis and design charts for the entire system such as: class diagram, ERD, DFD, collaboration diagram and more.
